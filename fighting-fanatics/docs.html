        Assets are all created by me using Adobe Photoshop!<br/>
        All js was written by me except for one provided by MDN <code>getRandomIntInclusive</code> <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random">here.</a><br/>
        The scope of the game for project submission has decreased considerably compared to the proposal, but I intend on improving and iterating on this as it was a lot of fun!<br/>
        The game uses DOM manipulation entirely, I wanted to challenge myself to not use pixiJS to make the game.<br/>
        The game also uses howler.js for sound effects. <a href="https://freesound.org/people/nekoninja/sounds/370204/">This is where I got the slash heard on click of Fight,</a> and <a href="https://freesound.org/people/lulyc/sounds/346116/"> here is the sound effect heard on healing.</a><br/>
        Thank you for reading!
